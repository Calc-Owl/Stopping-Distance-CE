This handy program calculates the safe stopping distance (which aids in determining a safe following distance) of a vehicle travelling at any km/h speed. You input the reaction time in seconds, the vehicle's speed, the roadway's grade (+/-), and the friction coefficient. From this data, the calculator gives the user the distance travelled in the reaction time (before any brake is applied) and the distance travelled with braking. You also get the sum of each, which is the total safe stopping distance of the vehicle.

This is a good tool for beginner drivers and for professional drivers who want to improve their skills on the road. You can also tinker with the formula and see how much reaction time and paying attention while driving impact the distance your vehicle travels if you have to stop suddenly.
