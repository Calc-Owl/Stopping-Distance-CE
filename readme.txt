STOPPINGDIST CE

About:

You can calculate the safe stopping distance of any vehicle.

Purpose:

Determine the safe stopping distance (therefore working out a safe travelling distance) for different speeds.

Instructions:

Input the reaction time in second. This is how long it takes the driver to apply the brake from the moment of realizing the need. Most people are around 1 sec, a good driver is 2. If you are distracted it can get high like 5-7 seconds. 

Input the speed of the vehicle in km/h.

Input the grade (slope) of the roadway in per cent. For example if sloping upward at a 5% grade simply put in 5. For downslopes add a negative number. Use 0 for flat.

Input the friction coefficient. Dry, clean pavement is 0.7/0.8, moderately wet pavement is 0.55, really wet pavement is 0.3 and ice would be 0.15. You can input and play with whatever value you like. This is a dec.

The calculator will display the distance the vehicle travels in the time it takes the driver to react (when no brake is apply), the distance the vehicle travels with the brake applied and the total of these two which is the official stopping distance.
